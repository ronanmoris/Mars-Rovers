# Udacity's Nanodegree Project 2: Mars Rovers 


### Big Picture

Students have to create a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. 
The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission.

### How to run it

Clone or download it by clicking on the green button(Code) on the right upper part of the screen.
